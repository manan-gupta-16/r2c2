## About the StarControl web UI:

#### Map UI
Provides the following functionalities:
+ The map displays the vehicle position, geofence, mission (whichever is selected) and the vehicle path. All of these can be toggled using the buttons.
+ The map can be viewed offline and is rendered using the leaflet library.
+ The map allows the user to draw a new geofence for the vehicle.
+ It provides a tree view of all the missions along with their mission tasks and displays the various pameters for each mission task.
+ The user can view and run missions using the UI.

#### Dashboard
Contains a series of gauges that display various parameters from the vehicle status.

#### Diagnostics
Displays the status and health of all the components of the AUV.

#### Sentuators
Displays various sensors and actuators, their health status and data received from them.

#### Script Control
Enables the user to control the AUVâ€™s behavior by uploading and running sub-routines from a script.
